==== DrakeUI (AntaresX Global Messenger (Chat) for Android) Change Log ====

VersionCode=12 (0.12)
	* Update UserPresenceView when server connection state changes.
	Mantis: 7685
	
VersionCode=11 (0.11)
	* remove signout menu item from ContactListActivity
		- this is a hangover from the gibberbot fork and DrakeUI should not
			signout from the chat service because other FC application
			may need to use the service.
