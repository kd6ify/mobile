		broadcast intents.  When a HttpQueueService receives the LOGIN_COMPLETED intent it will reset authentication
		credentials to be used on next server request.  HttpQueueService is common code used by all futurec apps.
		
VersionCode=24 (0.0.24)
	* When the service address is set from AdminSettings, start the SetPasswordActivity not DownloadConfigurationActivity.
		- the password needs to be set before DownloadConfigurationActivity will work
