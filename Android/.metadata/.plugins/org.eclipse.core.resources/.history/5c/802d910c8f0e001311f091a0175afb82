VersionCode=196 (6.0.146)
	* MainMapActivity launchMode="singleTask"--this solves the issue of a chained activity stack
		such as MainMapActivity->ViewAsset->MainMapActivity->ViewAsset
	Mantis: 8361
	* Update asset list header count when data changes
	Mantis: 8339
	
VersionCode=195 (6.0.145)
	* Show "ghost" assets in the Equipment or Personnel layers
		- easy fix: just do an LEFT OUTER JOIN (instead of INNER JOIN) on Equipment (or User)
		- was already doing a query on Asset.Status=UNKNOWN
	* Update version #
	Mantis: 8335
	
VersionCode=194 (6.0.144)

	Mantis: 7523

VersionCode=192 (6.0.142)
	* Restore Latitude/Longitude and zoom level in geo.MainMapActivity when orientation changes
		- there was existing code to handle this, but there was a bug that prevent the code from working
			correctly. 
	Mantis: 7639

	Mantis: 8308

	* Moved "Reset Data" menu item in LauncherActivity to AxSync SyncLogActivity
	Mantis: 8225
	* Hide the Incident/Operational Period select buttons in Launcher while a sync operation is in progress.
		- While trying to repro mantis 8173, I found that if I selected an incident while a sync operation
			was in progress the sync service got in a bad state.  
	Mantis: 8173
	* Fix regular task query in MainMapActivity--regular tasks in the current operational period
	Mantis: 7644
	* Add Source when viewing log entries (ViewJournalEntryActivity)
	Mantis: 8240

			simple_list_item_3
	Mantis: 8249
	
VersionCode=189 (6.0.139)
	* Fix crash in ViewItemActivity.getAddressView()
		- for some reason, an asset had a reference to an address that wasn't sync'd yet
			in that case just don't crash, just return "None" as the address until the address
			is synced.  Note: this situation should not occur.  I suspect there may be an issue
			with the launcher that was allowing a user to view assets before the incident was 
			completely synced.
	Mantis: 7809
	
VersionCode=188 (6.0.138)

			and when an incident is changed.

		(i.e. when the network is unreachable (lost connectivity))
	Mantis: 7496
