	Mantis: 8805
	
Version code=28 (0.0.28)
	1/13/2014
	* When SyncManager.deleteDataSet() is invoked, first clear the sync queue and abort any current SyncTransaction
		- When a new Incident is selected via IncidentSelectorActivity, SyncManager.deleteDataSet() is invoked
			before the new IncidentDataSet is synced.
		- This change should fix the missing sync progress view described in Mantis 8969
	Mantis: 8969

VersionCode=27 (0.0.27)
	* Modify String resource querys for UserList and equipment list.. change Outer Join with Inner Join.

VersionCode=26 (0.0.26)
	* Add dropTable to sync service and ResetData now calls dropTable instead of deleteTable
		- the ICDBProvider only drops the table if drop=true is passed in on the where clause
		- dropping the table during resetdata events will help ensure
			that schema state stays in sync when schema changes are made on the backend.
			It will also provide a means for recovery when the database or database schema
			become corrupted for whatever reason.
			
VersionCode=25 (0.0.25)
	* fix bug in SyncLocActivity where it was using the "AllTablesDataSet" to delete tables instead of
		StaticDataSet.  AllTablesDataSet is deprecated and does not contain all tables.

VersionCode=24 (0.0.24)
	* removed code in IncidentDataSet AxModel
		addItem(new IncidentDataSetTable("IncidentJournalEntry", Address.CONTENT_URI));
		addItem(new IncidentDataSetTable("Media", Address.CONTENT_URI));
	Mantis:8763,8800

VersionCode=23 (0.0.23)
	* removed code in ICDBProvider.delete(whereClause.equals("Media="))
	Mantis: 8623
	
VersionCode=22 (0.0.22)
	* Fix imcomplete incident data bug
		- handle IOException during HTTP transaction during sync operation, such as connection timeout
			this was causing incomplete incident data, i.e. not all personnel were showing in the roster
		- exceptions were handled at two low of a level in SyncTransaction and SyncService
	* Added new queue service to handle download sync errors (SqlDownloadErrorQueueService)
	* Created new activity (SqlDownloadErrorActivity) for user to handle fatal download errors
		(such as a server database in an unknown state)
	* Modified SyncLogActivity to listen to sync events even when the activity is paused (this will
		keep the UI up-to-date with sync activity
	* AxSync now depends on Android sdk 8 (version 2.2)
	* Commented-out Media and IncidentJournalEntryMedia from IncidentJournalDataSet--these
		datasets have not been deployed yet
	* Added new exception type (MobileServerException) which is thrown when 
		mobileserver returns an exception to AxSync
	* Added notifyDownloadError to (StatusBarNotifier)
	 
VersionCode=21 (0.0.21)
	* removed check on ExceptionType from onMenuRetryAllUploadErrors() in SqlUploadErrorActivity
	
VersionCode=20 (0.0.20)
	* added a "retry" menu option to the SqlUploadErrorActivity.  When the user
		selects this option, all exceptiontypes in the upload error queue matching the exceptiontype
		that the user was notified for will get moved to the upload queue (essentially causing all of them
		to get retried)
		A User alert is shown for both "retry" and "ignore" and the user must confirm (yes/no) to either
			retry the failed upload transaction or ignore the transactions.
	* UnknownHostException is handled similar to a NoRouteToHostException, except the
		UnknownHostException is retried in 5 minutes instead of 1 minute
	
VersionCode=19 (0.0.19)
	* Get latest android support library
	* rebuilt with latest android platform tools
	* Fixes to equipment query
	Mantis: 8334
	
VersionCode=18 (0.0.18)
	* Changed text when connected to AxSync service to "Synchronizer Service is running"
	Mantis: 8314
	* Removed "Sync Static" from SyncLogActivity--redundant option (Reset Data does the
		same thing and more).
	
VersionCode=17 (0.0.17)
	* Changed query_mappable query strings to use LEFT OUTER JOIN on Equipment and User
	
VersionCode=16 (0.0.16)
	* CurrentIncidentPeriodID and CurrentOperationalPeriodID managed by Mercury
	Mantis: 8321
	
VersionCode=15 (0.0.15)
	* Fix apparent hang in SyncLogActivity.  Synchronizer was actually still running, but the
		progress view wasn't updating correctly.
	Mantis: 8313
	
VersionCode=14 (0.0.14)
	* moved "Reset Data" from AxTrinity Launcher to here in SyncLogActivity
		- SyncLogActivity will display a warning if the user selects "Reset Data"
	Mantis: 8225
	* Removed ticker text from syncing notification..it was annoying
	
VersionCode=13 (0.0.13)
	* major bug fixes and enhancements to synchronizer so that:
		1) User has better feedback as to synchronizer progress (running, rescheduled, failed, etc.)
		- Added abort() method to ISyncTransaction and added _aborted boolean to SyncTransaction
			when _aborted=true the transaction will be discarded after HTTP call completes
		- Added more useful debug info to track down sync errors
		- fixed bug in StatusBarNotifier that was causing sync rescheduled
			notifications to get cleared so user didn't know sync failed
			and will be rescheduled.
		- AIDL interfaces were not being used correctly in some cases
			i.e. SyncManager needed to pass interfaces to client
			using SyncTransaction.asInterface(_currentTransaction)
		- Added KEY_LAST_SYNC_ERROR_MESSAGE to AxSync.Config
		Mantis: 7862, 7859, 7863, 7772
	* fix issue where rescheduled sync notification was not showing.
	
VersionCode=11 (0.0.11)
	* stop current transaction and clean sync queue when new incident
		is selected (SyncManager.setCurrentIncidentID())
	Mantis: 7809
	
VersionCode=10 (0.0.10)
	* Version 9 didn't have manifest set correctly
	
VersionCode=9 (0.0.9)
	* Show new "No network connectivity." popup dialog during failed sync operations.  This
		- will give users the ability to retry sync immediately or wait until it's rescheduled.
	Mantis: 7496
	
VersionCode=8 (0.0.8)
	* Fixed background color for sync rescheduled notification message
	Mantis: 7533
	* Fix bug causing reschedule sync notification from never going away
	Mantis: 7530
	
VersionCode=7 (0.0.7)
	* "syncing..." popup dialog remains when sync service is rescheduled to run later
		(i.e. when the network is unreachable (lost connectivity))
	Mantis: 7496
	* Added query_incident_selector_list to improve performance of ax.trinity.IncidentSelectorActivity
	
VersionCode=6 (0.0.6)
	* fix corrupted build (5 was corrupted)
	Mantis: 7517
	
VersionCode=5 (0.0.5)
	* optimizations
		- Added query_distinct_equipment_list (see strings.xml) to optimize EquipmentListActivity
			(joined query)
		- removed sleep(5) from HttpQueueListener (this will reduce the amount of time the
			"Syncing..." popup is shown during sync operations.
			
VersionCode=4 (0.0.4)
	* Fix causing crashes when synchronizer is scheduled to re-run.
		- If the synchronizer is scheduled to re-run (i.e. lost network connectivity),
			listeners will not receive ISyncListener.onStop() message
			until the scheduled sync runs to completion.
	Mantis: 7510, 7512, 7494, 7496
			
VersionCode=3 (0.0.3)
	* Fix synchronizer issue caused by last sync version (change tracking) not getting reset
		on incident changes
	
VersionCode=2 (0.0.2)
