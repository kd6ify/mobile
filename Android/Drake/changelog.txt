==== Drake (AntaresX XMPP Messenger Service for Android) Change Log ====

VersionCode=45 (0.45)
	* Fixed version # in manifest
	Mants: 8312
	
VersionCode=44 (0.44)
	* Show notification for authentication errors
		- Based on the recent attached logcats,
			the login issue was caused by an authentication error.
			Bad username/password.
			DrakeService 44 has a fix that will now show a notification on authentication errors.
			If the DrakeService cannot connect to the chat server for whatever reason and the
			"offline" notification is shown a new error notification is also shown giving
			details (description) of why the connection to the server failed.

VersionCode=43 (0.43)
	* Send "gone" chat state when user closes chat session from NewChatActivity
	Mantis: 7664
	
VersionCode=42 (0.42)
	* re-export build--corrupted build?
	
VersionCode=41 (0.41)
	* queue postponed messages when server connection state is anything other than "LOGGED_IN".
		Previously, queueing was only done when state was "SUSPENDED", which is not always the
		case when disconnected or in the middle of connect attempt.

VersionCode=40 (0.40)
	* removed DeliveryReceipt handling to Drake--we are currently not supporting this.
	Mantis: 7536
	
VersionCode=39 (0.39)
	* incoming file transfer requests are automatically rejected until file transfer work is completed.
		Work is almost done, just needs tweaking and developer testing.

		Android.  NOTE: Intent may be NULL in onStart()
	Mantis: 7543

	* Fix: launch DrakeUI when Drake service "Online" notification is tapped.
	Mantis:  7387

VersionCode=36 (0.36)
	* Implemented new MessengerServiceConnection to assist
		in maintaining a connection between Messenger Service Clients
		and the messenger service.  Should improve stability.
		
VersionCode=35 (0.35)
	* Start the AntaresX Messenger Service (DrakeService) after device
		boot completes (android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED)
		
VersionCode=34 (0.34)
	* Bug fixes to service binder stuff 
		- created new ServiceBinder class in DrakeClient project
	Mantis: 7302
	
VersionCode=33 (0.33)
	* Split Drake into two applications: Drake and DrakeUI
		- Drake is the XMPP service component
		- DrakeUI is the UI component
	darnold
		
VersionCode=32 (0.32)
	* fix crash in XmppConnection.leaveAsync() when user attempts to sign-out of Drake when
		the connection to the server has been lost.
	Mantis: 7230
	* Make "Hide Offline Contacts" default=true
	Mantis: 6999
	
VersionCode=31 (0.31)
	* Files received by Drake in a chat session can now be viewed by tapping
		on the file transfer progress message or by opening the notification.
		(when the message says "Viewable" you can tap on it)
	Mantis: 7128
	* Incoming file transfer now show a progress message (shown as a percentage)
	Mantis: 6993
	* Drake nows uses the Android Media.Storage subsystem for storing incoming file
		transfers.  Files are browsable/viewable using the Gallery app.
	Mantis: 7034
	* Drake now recognizes JPG, PNG and BMP mime types.
	Mantis: 6974 
	
	
VersionCode=30 (0.30)
	* Started work on XEP-0184 implementation
		- Added delivery icon to each outgoing message in MessageView
			(icon will show an undelivered state (red x) until it is delivered (green check)
			Delivery just means the client has received the message.  It doesn't necessarily mean
			the client application has actually presented the message in the UI yet or that the user
			has read it. 
		- All outgoing messages have a XEP-0184 receipt tag
		- All incoming messages with a XEP-0184 extension are processed and the associated message
			in the database is marked delivered.  This will cause the UI to update (from red X to green CHECK)
		- Outgoing messages sent from the UI are queued if there is no network connectivity
		- TODO: Every undelivered message has an associated retransmit timer and these are retransmitted when
			the timer fires.
	
VersionCode=29 (0.29)
	* make password-protected chat group errors friendlier
	Mantis: 7219
	* Fix confusing layout in JoinChatGroupActivity
	Mantis: 7217
	* Removed "Add Contact" menu item from ContactListActivity.  Contacts are fetched from the
		server's roster.
	Mantis: 7011
	* Changes to DrakeSigningInActivity: autoRetryLogin=true.  Using false caused a strange state.
	Mantis: 6669

	Mantis: 7181
	* Toggle between menu name "Grouped" and "Filtered" in ContactListView

VersionCode=28 (0.28)
	* Removed TabbedContainer (Activity), ActiveChatListActivity ("Conversations")

VersionCode=27 (0.27)
	* Fix join chat room in ContactListView (group view).  It wasn't launching JoinChatGroupActivity
		if the selected contact was a chat room.
	Mantis: 7215, 7214
	* Chat rooms and chatting contacts are always shown even if "Hide Offline Contacts" is checked
	Mantis: 6902, 7166, 7168, 6892
	* Selecting menu->End Chat from NewChatActivity for a chat room causes other users to see
		"user has left" messages.

VersionCode=26 (0.26)
	* Rejoin password-protected rooms during XMPP connection reconnect
	
VersionCode=25 (0.25)
	* Added chat group support (other than just the LARCOPP/AntaresX room)
		- chat rooms (Chat groups) are shown in the contact list along with other contacts
		- tapping on a chat room will launch JoinChatGroupActivity
		- JoinChatGroupActivity will:
			- attempt to join the chat room and if successful, start a NewChatActivity session
			- if the join fails, an alert is presented to the user.  The user can dismiss the
				alert and try again by clicking "Join Chat Group".  This will give the user
				the opportunity to enter a password if the alert was "room is password-protected"
				or a previously entered password was incorrect.
				
VersionCode=24 (0.24)
	* Disable auto-joining the AntaresX (LARCOPP) chat room
	darnold
	
VersionCode=23 (0.23)
	* Fix crash when sending video, but JPG selected/sent instead.
	Mantis: 7172
	* Eliminate the possibility of duplicate contact records getting added.  This will probably fix the 
		bug where some contacts show as offline when they really are not.
	Mantis: 7171
	* Removed the "Send File" menu option from NewChatActivity.
	Mantis: 6806
	* Make the "Online"/"Offline" notification ONGOING so it doesn't disappear when you tap it.
	Mantis: 6822
	
VersionCode=22 (0.22)
	* Fix bug when attempting to send video files
	Mantis: 7127
	
VersionCode=21 (0.21)
	* many bug fixes for file transfer and group chat
	Mantis: 7033
	* disable send video, send image and send file for group chat
	Mantis: 7053
	* Support settings menu in ChatListActivity
	Mantis: 6777
	
VersionCode=20 (0.20)
	* Support Socks5 bytestreams so Tobias can test Corvus
	
VersionCode=19 (0.19)
	* Chat Groups (rooms) are shown in ContactListView when offline contacts are hidden
	Mantis: 6902
	
VersionCode=18 (0.18)
	* Refresh ContactListFilterView when pref_hide_offline_contacts changes.
	Mantis: 6905
	
VersionCode=17 (0.17)
	* Added support for showing only online contacts.  Settings in the UI had this setting, but
		the underlying framework didn't support it.  This fixes the crash reported in:
	Mantis: 6885, 6901
	
VersionCode=16 (0.16)
	* Fix bug causing "postponed" messages (messages queued when connection to server is lost)
		to be discarded.  Now, when the Drake user sees the "Connection to server lost." in
		NewChatActivity and continues to send messages those messages will be sent when the
		connection is restored.
	Mantis: 6889
	
VersionCode=15 (0.15)
	* Added crude chat room list ChatRoomListActivity.  It doesn't do much right now, but it's invoked 
		through the ContactListActivity menu.  This required a lot of plumbing to hook up to new services.
		Once we figure out how chat rooms will be negotiated we can improve it.
	* Removed unnecessary auto-join to LARCOPP when you finish the main activity and relaunch.
	* Close custom status EditText when the user taps "Done".
		I had to use this ugly code to get this to work--googling revealed we might need to do this a lot
                InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager)mContext.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
                imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(v.getWindowToken(), 0);
    Mantis: 6825
	 
VersionCode=14 (0.14)
	* Added "Show Participants" menu item to NewChatActivity for group chats
		- this menu option will show the active/online participants to a chat room

VersionCode=13 (0.13)
	* Don't call IChatSession.closeSession() in NewChatActivity
		on menu_end_conversation when IChatSession.isGroupSession() == true.
	Mantis: 6811
	* Change "Quit" to "Sign Out" in the ChatListActivity as well
	Mantis: 6805
	
VersionCode=12 (0.12)
	* Added incoming file transfer UI acceptance/rejection. Previously, when a remote user sent a file to
		a Drake user, Drake would just happily store the file on the device, regardless of whether the user
		actually wanted it.  Now, Drake prompts the user to either accept the file or reject it.  This actually
		was a difficult change requiring new methods in several interfaces and classes.
	* Messages sent in a chat room now only appear once
	Mantis: 6796
	* Added "Send Image" and "Send Video" menu items, which launch the corresponding photo/video pickers.
	Mantis: 6806
	* When users join/leave chat rooms, show nickname instead of fully qualified XMPP resource jid
	Mantis: 6797
	* Changed menu from "Quit" to "Sign Out"
	Mantis: 6805
	* Changed menu from "Verify" to "View Profile"
	Mantis: 6803
	* Remove OTR menu functions from chat rooms.  Off-The-Record (OTR) encryption features are
		not support for chat rooms.  This should fix the crash too.
	Mantis: 6800, 6801
	
VersionCode=11 (0.11)
	* Fix crash during QUIT (handleQuit in ContactListActivity)
	Mantis: 6778
	* Fix broken Settings
	Mantis: 6777
	
VersionCode=10 (0.10)
	* first pass at send file
		- to invoke send-file, start a peer-to-peer chat with someone (not chat room), and tap Menu->Send File
		- Send file requires/depends on the File Manager application (install FileManager.apk)
	Mantis: 6742
	
VersionCode=9 (0.9)
	* first pass at chat groups (Rooms) - currently auto joins the "LARCOPP" room
	Mantis: 6699
	
VersionCode=8 (0.8)
	* Fix "Signing in..." hang when run for the first time
		- actually a null pointer exception in DrakeSigningInActivity.onResume() caused in connectService()
		- problem caused by trying to reference Provider info before provider info was created
	Mantis:  6672
	
VersionCode=7 (0.7)
	* Add stack trace to "bad things" in DrakeSigningInActivity.onResume()
	
VersionCode=6 (0.6)
	* First pass at implementation of file transfer reception
		(users of Drake can receive files)
		
VersionCode=5 (0.5)
	* fix bug in DrakeSingingInActivity causing hang in first activity
	Mantis: 6591
	
VersionCode=4 (0.4)
	* Added new home screen icon
	Mantis: 6579
	
VersionCode=3 (0.3)
	* Defined XMPP Config profile.
		- Mercury defines xmpp_config_profile, xmpp_username, xmpp_password.
		- Drake XMPPConfigFactory instantiatates a specific XMPP configuration based
			on the mercury setting xmpp_config_profile.
		- Currently, only the xmpp_config_profile "google-talk" is defined.
			When there is a publicly available XMPP server, a XMPP configuration
			profile will be defined for it.
			
VersionCode=2 (0.2)
	* In AccountActivity, modified to accept username/domain without root domain.  For example,
		it will accept "user@doc1" without requiring a ".com" domain.
		
VersionCode=1 (0.1)
	* Fork of Gibberbot 0.0.8
	* Initial branding work
