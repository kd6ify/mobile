		-- you can you mark a placemark/waypoint without a gps signal.  The placemark is
			created with a lat/lon of 0.  The user must edit the placemark and put in an actual location at some time, or the placemark
			will show up off the coast of Africa.

VersionCode=8 (0.8)
	* Added new MainScreen 
	* Added Computer (Telemetry) screen showing GPS Status--this replace the old Gps status layer shown on the map that
		was difficult to read.  This also include altitude.
	Mantis: 2764

	* Changes to the GPS Status layer
	* Fixes to route recorder (wasn't showing tracks correctly)
	
VersionCode=5 (0.5.0)
	* New menu item "My Location"--tapping on it will always center on current
		location. When the current location changes, it will not re-center the map. You
		must tap "My Location" to re-center. This matches what I think the user expects
		because it is how google maps/navigation also works.
	* address search--can be activated from Routes activity. Menu->Directions,
		enter address. A route will be created from current location to addresses
		location and you can view the destination on the map.
	* I fixed a bug where the waypoints activity wasn't showing waypoints created
		outside of a route. They will show up now.
	* New preferences activity--can set distance units (metric or imperial) and
		coordinate display format (degrees, minutes, seconds)--will add UTM later.
	* New "GPS Status" layer will show GPS status info. This layer includes lat/lon
		(in coordinate preference), altitude (in distance preference) and speed
		(miles/hr or km/hr depending on distance preference), bearing, error (+/-
	accuracy and number of satellites)
	* Zoom layer is not lost on orientation change
	* Removed Skyhook location provider; it was causing problems with wifi getting turned on/off at the wrong times.
		Since this project is for backcountry navigation, wifi location is probably not necessary.
