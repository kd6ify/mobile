==== AntaresX Mobile Services Change Log ====
Version 7.0.46
	Added new Device configuration "VsmServerAddress"--this
	is used by iOS Video Viewer for connecting to a VSM service
	(either the PHP VSM web service or WOWZA IP Camera Integration
	module)

Version 7.0.45
	Added new section under configSections:
	-IncidentNotes.
	-IncidentCollectionAddress.
	Added Initial, InsertsAndUpdates and Deletes querys for:
	-IncidentNotes.
	-IncidentCollectionAddress.

Version 7.0.44
	Added suport for InsertandUpdates/Delete queries in table:
	-Gender.
	-AgencyType.
	-AddressType
	-Agency
	-Icon
	-SourceType
	-INCITS38200x
	-IncidentType
	-AssetType
	-AssetStatus
	-EquipmentType
	-UserType
	-UserRankType
	-JournalType
	-JournalStatus
	-TacticType
	-TacticStatus
	-TacticPriority
	-TriageStatus
	-TriageColor
	-CollectionType

Version 7.0.43
	Add AuthToken HTTP header to Authenticate service

Version 7.0.42
	Call CheckAuthorization() in all service methods in
		ICDBResource that return SyncResults or TransactionContextV3
		was only in SyncInitialTable.
	-- not calling CheckAuthorization() was preventing the
		AuthToken from getting sent in HTTP responses, which
		forced clients to go through the HEAVYWEIGHT LDAP
		authentication on each and every ICDB transaction

Version 7.0.41
	Added New Settings to MobileServerSettings.cs:
		-Setting MediaImagesServerUserName.
		-Setting MediaImagesServerService.
		-Setting MediaImagesServerPassword.
	Added Properties to DeviceConfiguration:
		-MediaImagesServerAddress.
		-MediaImagesServerUser.
		-MediaImagesServerPassword.

Version 7.0.40
	Added  <IncidentJournalEntryAddress> query and IncidentJournalEntryAddress to configSections

Version 7.0.39
	Added  <IncidentAddressExtraInfo> query and IncidentAddressExtraInfo to configSections

Version 7.0.38
	Added <IncidentDrawingAddress> query and IncidentDrawingAddress to configSections

Version 7.0.37

	Added MediaImagesServerAddress setting to DeviceConfiguration.
	Added MediaImagesServerService on MobileServerSettings that store default value for MediaImagesServerAddress.

Version 7.0.36
	* Added IncidentJournalEntryMedia table to configSections and the queries for this table in app.config.
	* Added Media table to configSections and the queries for this table in app.config.

Version 7.0.35
	* Clear device context from DeviceContextManager on Admin.DownloadConfiguration request
		- this prevents the situation where MobileServer caches equipment queries
			that may become out-of-date when the equipment changes (such as Equipment.Name
			used by Mercury for DeviceName).

Version 7.0.34
	* Added IncidentRequest and IncidentRequestStatus tables

Version 7.0.33
	* Fix "Incident" and "OperationalPeriod" query string in app.config.
		String.Format string was incorrect
		Changed "WHERE CT.SYS_CHANGE_OPERATION='{2}'" "to WHERE CT.SYS_CHANGE_OPERATION='{1}'"
	Mantis: 6265

Version 7.0.32
	* Send DeviceName (Equipment.Name) back to device during DownloadConfiguration (Admin/GetConfiguration)
		which eventually gets stored on device in the Mercury configuration
		and later used during WSUS update client registration

Version 7.0.31
	* Major changes to handling updates.
		- Removed all update code and moved into WSUS Bridge Service (Project20\SystemTools\Update\Bridge).
		- Admin/GetConfiguration() now returns WSUSBridgeServiceAddress to device.

Version 7.0.30
	* Pass authentication if DeviceID is registered > 0 equipment records.  Previously, it had to be in one and only one
		equipment record.
		The name and equipmentID used for the deviceContext are from the first Equipment record found.
	Mantis: 5989

Version 7.0.29
	* Fix IncidentPerson and IncidentUser queries to pick up changes to the User and Asset tables that directly
		or indirectly reference the Person table.  Also, the query configuration changes (Inserts and Updates
		were combined into InsertsAndUpdates)

Version 7.0.28

	Mantis: 5035
	* Fix typo in TriageColor query

		set.

Version 7.0.25
	* Fixed bug with DateTimeOffset causing insert/updates to fail.
	Mantis: 5796

Version 7.0.24

	Mantis: 5190

Version 7.0.16
	* fix client "connection reset" when attempting to sync IncidentAsset with large # of assets
		-	Error seen in MobileServer.svclog:
			System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089
			Maximum number of items that can be serialized or deserialized in an object graph is '65536'. Change the object graph or increase the MaxItemsInObjectGraph quota. 
		- # of objects needed to do an initial sync of IncidentAsset=N*C*2 (N=asset count, C=38 columns, 2=each column requires name/value pair)
		- Jose and Dave agree on a 15,000 assets per incident limit of 15000
			15000*38*2=1140000
		- changed MaxItemsInObjectGraph to 1140000

		- webHttpBinding.authWebBinding.readerQuotas.maxStringContentLength="2147483647"
	Mantis: 5052
	* Fixed bug in TrackerV3 service.  It was using the incorrect connection string
		WAS
			SqlProvider sqlProvider = new SqlProvider(); // use default connection string
		NOW
			MobileServerSettings settings = new MobileServerSettings();
			SqlProvider sqlProvider = new SqlProvider(settings.ICDBIsolatedConnectionString);
	Mantis: 5066

Version 7.0.9
	* Added logic to handle expired change tracking data as
		described in "Validating the Last Synchronized Version"
		in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc280358.aspx
		When a Trinity device attempts to synchronize with a table
		using a given last_synch_version that is too old
		because the data has expired, MobileServer will force an
		initial synchronization on that table.
